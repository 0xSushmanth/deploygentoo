this is a gentoo deployment script created by mental outlaw
this script is started by running the file called setup_gentoo.sh, it should be run from inside the folder it came in.
this script should be run right after you have formatted your disk, mounted it, and confirmed your network connection is up.
there is some manual input needed from the user (you'll have to give a username, password, aswell as tell the script what disk you want gentoo installed to and choose your kernel options (you can use my kernel config or make your own))
