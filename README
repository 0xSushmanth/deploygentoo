this is a gentoo deployment script created by mental outlaw
1. Run setup_gentoo.sh it will prompt you to provision your disk, or you can auto provision using my recommended format
2. The script is going to prompt you to answer several questions to configure your installation(LibreSSL Replacement, LTO Optimizations, kernel editing, and platform selection).  After this the setup will do its thing (it takes several minutes)
3. When this finishes you'll have a working gentoo linstallation with my minimal kernel config and use flags, exit the chroot, remove the live cd and reboot.
4. From here you could go on and customize gentoo to your liking, or deploy my included "rice" (gui configuration and dotfiles) with sudo deploy_rice.sh. Currently I use urxvt, dwm, slstatus, pcmanfm, zsh, bash, and vim.
5. You can also run install_software.sh to install a list of software that I use on gentoo.
