this is a gentoo deployment script created by mental outlaw
before running the script, make sure you have downloaded your stage3, and that you have
moved this scripts folder into the same directory as it
DO NOT open the STAGE3 on your own, the script will do it for you :D
this script is started by running the file called setup_gentoo.sh, it should be run from inside the folder it came in.
there is some manual input needed from the user (you'll have to give a username, password, aswell as tell the script what disk you want gentoo installed to and choose your kernel options (you can use my kernel config or make your own))
