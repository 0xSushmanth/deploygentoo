this is a gentoo deployment script created by mental outlaw
1. Run setup_gentoo.sh after you have provisioned, formatted, and mounted to /mnt/gentoo the disk you plan to install on.
2. The script is going to prompt you to answer several questions to configure your installation.  After this the setup will do its thing (it takes several minutes)
3. When this finishes you'll have to configure your users password and root password.  After you reboot you'll have a work base gentoo installation
4. From here you could go on and customize gentoo to your liking, or deploy my included "rice" (gui configuration and dotfiles) with sudo deploy_rice.sh. Currently I use dwm, pcmanfm, zsh, bash, and vim.
5. You can also run install_software.sh to install a list of software that I use on gentoo.
